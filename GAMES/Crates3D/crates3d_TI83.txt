Changes in Version 1.1
======================
The level editor is now compatible with TI-86 level sets.


How to Run
==========
Crates 3D requires Venus 2.x to run.

To run Crates 3D, make sure Venus is installed on your calculator.

Send CRATES.83P and C3DSTD.83P to your calculator.

Start Crates 3D by selecting CRATES from the PRGM-menu and hitting enter.


About
=====
Crates 3D is an original puzzle game in which you must guide yourself
through a three-dimensional world of moveable crates to the exit. You
can view the world from four different angles. The game comes with 16
standard levels, and a level editor is included so that you can create
your own.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, press the 2ND key to play the selected level set.
Crates 3D comes with one level set called "Standard".

Each level is built entirely from white crates. You control a black
crate, which you can move around with the arrow keys. The aim in each
level is to reach the other black crate and stand on top of it. The
first three levels in the Standard set are training levels.

On level 1, move all the way to the right. You will find yourself
hidden by a wall. You need to rotate the view with the Y= and WINDOW
keys to see what is behind the wall. Once you have moved past the wall,
move across to the black crate and stand on top of it to win the level.

On level 2, you will see that you can use crates as steps, just by
moving onto then in the normal fashion. You cannot step up or down more
than one crate high.

On level 3, you will encounter a gap that is too deep to cross. You need
to push a crate into the gap to continue. Position yourself behind the
single crate, hold down the 2ND key and move in the direction you want
to push it. The crate will fall into the gap, allowing you to pass.

You can change between levels with the plus and minus keys, and restart
a level by pressing DEL. Press CLEAR to return to the menu. When you
play the level set again, you will be returned to the start of the level
that you were on.


Laws of Crates 3D
=================
Whilst playing level 3, you may have noticed the following three rules:

* Crates 3D does not obey the law of conservation of crates.
If a crate does not have anything to fall onto, it will disappear into
nothingness.

* Inert crates are not affected by gravity.
If a crate is pushed out from underneath another crate, the top crate
will not fall down but will remain suspended in mid-air.

* Some crates are immovable.
For a crate to be moveable, there must be a crate below it, but no crate
in its way.


Tips
====
The standard levels are arranged in order of difficulty, so tackle them
in sequence.

The three-dimensional view can sometimes bring about optical illusions,
although the standard levels have been carefully designed to avoid this
wherever possible. If you cannot see a part of a level properly, always
rotate the view so that you can. There is usually at least one angle
that will let you see clearly. Even for the more difficult levels, it
won't take long for you to obtain a strong grasp of the three-
dimensional layout of the level.

Although not a common situation, crates cannot be pushed outside the
invisible bounds of the 32x24x8 levels.


Level Editor
============
The level editor runs under Windows 3.1 or above. Just extract the
contents of the ZIP file into a directory and run CRATES3D.EXE.

The level editor is easy-to-use and provides a three-dimensional 
preview. It opens and saves 83P and 8XP files, so once you have created
a level set you can send it directly to your calculator.

Avoid creating levels that have lots of crates around the one area, as
this will cause the game to run slowly. Even crates that are completely
hidden by other crates will slow the game down, so if a crate is not
necessary, remove it. For example, a pyramid of crates should be hollow
and have no base, since any crates inside would not be visible from any
angle.

When creating levels, keep an eye on the 3D preview to prevent optical
illusions. Leave generous gaps between different sections of your levels
so that, from at least one angle, they don't overlap in the 3D view.

Send any level sets that you create to me and/or to web sites such as
ticalc.org, so that they can be enjoyed by other players of Crates 3D.
